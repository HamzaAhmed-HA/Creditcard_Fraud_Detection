Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
Overview
This project conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset to uncover patterns and anomalies in transaction data that may indicate fraudulent activity. Through detailed analysis and visualization, the project highlights trends, distinguishing factors of fraud, and key insights that can guide future fraud detection efforts.

Key Features
Data Analysis: Analyzed transaction data to understand its structure, distributions, and patterns.
Fraud Identification: Highlighted proportions of fraudulent versus legitimate transactions.
Statistical Insights: Generated descriptive statistics for significant features, such as transaction amounts.
Visualizations:
Bar chart comparing the count of fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Histogram displaying the distribution of transaction amounts.
Heatmap illustrating correlations among numerical features.
Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
pandas and numpy for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab for interactive EDA.
Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Details:
Includes anonymized features to protect privacy.
Contains a target variable (Class) indicating:
1: Fraudulent transactions.
0: Legitimate transactions.
How to Run
Download the dataset (creditcard.csv) from the Kaggle source.
Upload the dataset to your Colab environment or place it in your local working directory.
Execute the notebook cells sequentially to perform EDA and generate insights.
Insights Gained
Fraudulent transactions are rare compared to legitimate transactions, reflecting class imbalance.
Transaction amounts for fraud and legitimate transactions display distinct patterns.
Certain feature correlations, as highlighted in the heatmap, may aid in identifying fraud.
Future Scope
Advanced Modeling: Implement machine learning models for more robust fraud detection.
Real-Time Systems: Explore pipelines for real-time fraud detection in financial systems.
Feature Engineering: Identify and test engineered features to improve detection accuracy.
