Credit Card Transactions Fraud Detection - EDA Project
Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset to identify patterns and anomalies in transaction data that may indicate fraudulent behavior. The analysis provides insights into transaction trends, distinguishing factors of fraud, and visual representations of the data.

Key Features
Analyzed transaction data to understand its structure and characteristics.
Identified fraudulent and legitimate transactions with their proportions.
Generated descriptive statistics for key features like transaction amount.
Created visualizations:
Bar chart comparing fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions.
Histogram of transaction amounts.
Heatmap for correlation between numerical features.
Technologies Used
Python: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn
Jupyter/Colab Notebook for interactive analysis
Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset
Contains anonymized features and transaction data, including a target variable (Class) indicating fraud (1) or legitimate (0).
How to Run
Download the dataset from Kaggle.
Upload the creditcard.csv file to the Colab notebook or place it in your working directory.
Run the notebook to perform EDA and generate visualizations.
Insights Gained
Fraudulent transactions are significantly less frequent than legitimate ones.
Transaction amounts for fraud and legitimate transactions vary distinctly.
Correlations between certain features may help detect fraud.
Future Scope
Implement advanced fraud detection models using machine learning.
Explore real-time fraud detection pipelines for financial systems.
